<h1>Chapter 2: The Humiliation</h1>
<p>10:23 am.

    Sheepishly, the man wandered over to his workmates who were already in the process of presenting their pitch to their supervisor. The man tuned out the dialogue being spoken at the time, when it was his turn to speak he did so in a robotic manner. The words were well rehearsed, yet his demeanor contradicted his speech. Whether it was the fact that the hem of his pants were soaked and speckled with dirty snow, or the fact that he was still wearing his winter coat; the room seemed to be more critical of his message. He finished the presentation and quietly made his way to his desk. His coworker patted him on the shoulder, his other coworker avoided his gaze. They looked cold and stern, the man knew he fucked up.

“Sorry guys” The man said, looking at the floor.

“It’s okay, I think the boss man was pretty keen on our ideas.” Assured the coworker who was warm to him.

“Punctuality is key, it sullies the presentation when you show up the way you did…” Said the other coworker who was not as impressed with the man’s tardiness.

With a humble nod of the head, the man shrunk into his seat. He just wanted this day to be over already.
