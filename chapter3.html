<h1>Winter Rush</h1>
<h2>Chapter 3: Stuffy Room</h2>
<p>6:36 pm.</p>
<p>As the man crossed the plaza in the opposite direction from which he came earlier in the day, he thought about the snow. He thought about the cold wind licking his face. This time his cadence was meandering, sluggish almost. There wasn’t any haste to get home. Defeated and questioning his existence, he looked towards the gray clouds and the pale sky. He wondered why he did any of this. Watching the other pedestrians in the plaza, he didn’t plan his path this time. Rather, he became aware of the crowd and how it breathed, like a super organism. Days like this were not new to him, but that didn’t make it any less exhausting.
</p>
<p>Sporadic movement accompanied with a blistering pace, a figure appeared in front of the man almost at an instant. As the two people collided the man scrunched his face and the corners of his mouth tensed downward. 
</p>
<p>“Sorry, man.” A man in an ochre bubble coat said quickly.
</p>
<p>“...” The man glared at bubble coat.
</p>
<p>Seeing the whites of the man’s eyes along with concentrated pupils, the bubble coat man skipped away as quickly as he collided with the man. The man felt the fear that the stranger exuded towards him. <em>Sons of Anarchy</em>, he thought. Like opening a window in a stuffy room, the man’s atmosphere and aura shifted. He thought about the wind, the snow, but then he thought about the concrete beneath his feet as he continued to walk. He was a part of this place, he knew his role because he chose it. Whatever his role was that day or that hour he knew he was going to play it, whether he wanted to or not.
</p>
<p>The bearded man happened to be crossing the plaza as well, but did not recognize the man and continued walking at his surefooted pace.
