<h1>Winter Rush</h1>
<h2>Chapter 1: Walking Slosh</h2>
<p>10:14 am.</p>
<p>The cadence of the man’s legs as he trudged through the gray slosh was frantic and squirrely. One could hardly call the snow on the ground “snow” any more, but this was a normal occurrence considering the circumstances. The city consumed everything that chose to inhabit it, chewed it up, and spit it out. With enough time anything that stayed in the city became a part of the city, nature was no exception. So through the slosh, the man hurried, he was not mindful of the ground wetting his slacks or his shoes. All that mattered to him was to save face. His eyes darted around the other pedestrians walking across the plaza. The man was planning the most efficient path around people for the next block or so. Through the mass of people he felt a current, he needed to be able to ebb and flow in order to get to his destination.
</p>
<p>As the man reached the heart of the crowd his brow furrowed, he sucked in his lips, and his shoulders rose slightly. Tilting his gaze towards the ground, he focused on the legs of the other people making their way through the space. Suddenly, a pair of gray, distressed Doc Martens came into his field of vision. The cadence of these shoes were quicker than the surrounding ones, however they were not as quick as the man’s or as uneasy. In fact, these steps were calm, however the difference in speed was enough to throw the man off his rhythm. It was too late, he collided with another body.
</p>
<p> “Sorry about that.” The man blurted out.
</p>
<p>“Watch out.” Grumbled a bearded man looking less than amused with the situation at hand.</p>
<p>The man straightened his jacket, at the same time gazing at the stranger. His eyes likened those of a deer in headlights, he didn’t want any trouble with the bearded man who looked like he just came out a successful casting call for the Sons of Anarchy. Apologizing once more, the man slipped away and left the plaza ground towards the street, stopping at the crosswalk. Embarrassed and slightly frustrated the man’s eyes were beaming towards an office building.
